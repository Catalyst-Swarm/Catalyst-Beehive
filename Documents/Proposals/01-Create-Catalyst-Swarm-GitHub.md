## Suggestion – To create a “Catalyst Swarm” GitHub Organization and Repositories.

The purpose of this GitHub Organization and Repositories will be to store code, data and documents produced by Catalyst Swarm. And to track changes using GitHub’s audit trail, provide a means to publicly review or approve changes to decision documents and achieve open-source recognition.

## GitHub Organization Owner(s)

The GitHub Organization should be created by someone who will not be a repository maintainer – as they will have ultimate moderation authority (e.g., deletion, removal) and be responsible for receipt of GitHub fundraising (or bills if additional services are purchased).
I suggest one of the core Swarm group (please add to this list)

Name(s)

## Possible Repo Maintainers (please add to this list)

Tevo, George Lovegrove, Ro, Phil K, Stephen Whitenstall (Rowan) ….
The first repositories

## Organizing Ideascale Problem Sensing Ideas

Suggested maintainer(s) : Tevo, George Lovegrove, Stephen Whitenstall (Rowan)

This repository will hold the data and documentation for the Saturday Catalyst Swarm Session “Organizing Ideascale Problem Sensing Ideas”. It’s README file will provide an overview of this activity and a link to the Catalyst Swarm website. It will provide a record of links to content on Miro, Google Docs etc. It will be managed by this Swarm group.

## The-Beehive (or other name)

Suggested maintainer(s) : Tevo,  … ?

This repository will hold all the “decision” data and documentation of the core Catalyst Swarm group. For example, this is a decision document. Text documentation will be converted to markdown files and stored in category folders. This will enable full visibility of any changes to the community and provide a possible means to build review processes in the future (e.g., like Cardano Metadata Repository). It will be managed by the core Swarm group.

## Catalyst Swarm GitBook (or other name)

Suggested maintainer(s) : Stephen Whitenstall (Rowan), …

This will be a GitBook frontend to a GitHub backend. It will provide an interim solution to documenting the history of Catalyst Swarm. It will provide a context for Meeting and session recordings, Miro Boards, Discord channels and post, Youtube and social media content.

It will be set-up in a “repository first” configuration – so that the content may be easily migrated to an alternative archiving platform in the future.
